NLP Disaster Tweets
This repository contains the code for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that classifies tweets as either disaster or non-disaster tweets. The project uses a variety of NLP techniques, including text cleaning, feature extraction, and machine learning.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries.
Run the nlpproject.ipynb notebook.
Data
The data for this project is a collection of tweets that were collected during the 2017 Hurricane Harvey disaster. The data was collected by the Center for Disaster Philanthropy.

Code
The code for this project is written in Python. The code is organized into the following notebooks:

data_cleaning.ipynb: This notebook cleans the data and prepares it for analysis.
feature_extraction.ipynb: This notebook extracts features from the data.
machine_learning.ipynb: This notebook trains a machine learning model to classify tweets as either disaster or non-disaster tweets.


Conclusion
This project demonstrates how NLP techniques can be used to classify tweets as either disaster or non-disaster tweets. The project achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set, which shows that NLP techniques can be used to effectively classify tweets.
